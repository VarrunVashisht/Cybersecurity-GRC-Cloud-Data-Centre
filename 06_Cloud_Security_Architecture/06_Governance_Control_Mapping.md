# Governance and Architecture Control Mapping

## 1. Governance Enforcement
Security architecture enforces:
- Approved design patterns
- Mandatory security controls
- Risk-based decision-making

## 2. Control Mapping Examples
- IAM architecture → NIST AC & IA
- Network segmentation → NIST SC
- Logging → NIST AU & DE
- Encryption → NIST PR.DS

## 3. Continuous Improvement
Architecture is reviewed regularly to:
- Address emerging threats
- Align with updated compliance requirements
- Reduce risk exposure
