# Network and Perimeter Security Architecture

## 1. Network Segmentation
- Separate management, production, and monitoring networks
- Use of virtual private networks (VPCs)

## 2. Traffic Controls
- Firewalls and security groups
- Network access control lists
- Secure gateways for external access

## 3. Zero Trust Principles
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Continuous verification of users and devices
