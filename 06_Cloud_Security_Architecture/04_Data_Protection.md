# Data Protection and Encryption Architecture

## 1. Data-at-Rest Protection
- Encryption for all storage services
- Centralized key management

## 2. Data-in-Transit Protection
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Secure APIs and endpoints

## 3. Key Management
- Role-based access to keys
- Key rotation and lifecycle management

## 4. GRC Mapping
Supports NIST PR.DS, ISO 27001 cryptographic controls, and privacy requirements.
