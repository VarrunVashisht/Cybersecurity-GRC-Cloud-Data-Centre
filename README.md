# 🛡️ Cybersecurity GRC Capstone Project

## Enterprise Cloud Data Center – End-to-End Implementation

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **full industry-grade Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) capstone project**, designed to mirror how **real cloud service providers (data centers)** design, implement, operate, audit, and report cybersecurity programs.

This is **not a theoretical or academic project**.
It represents **hands-on, real-world GRC implementation**, from business context to **CISO-level board reporting**.

> 🎯 **Audience:** CISOs, Hiring Managers, GRC Leads, Auditors, Risk Managers
> 🎯 **Industry:** Cloud Data Centers / Cloud Service Providers
> 🎯 **Frameworks:** NIST CSF, NIST RMF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, CSA

---

## 🏢 Business Scenario

**Organization:** Q-Day Cloud Services
**Industry:** Cloud Data Center & Managed Cloud Services
**Customers:** Finance, Healthcare, Government, Enterprise
**Role Simulated:** Cybersecurity GRC Analyst → Acting GRC Lead / CISO Advisor

The organization operates a **multi-tenant cloud platform** and must:

* Protect sensitive customer data
* Maintain high availability
* Meet regulatory and audit requirements
* Manage third-party and supply-chain risk
* Report cyber risk to executives and the Board

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* Design **enterprise cybersecurity governance**
* Perform **cloud risk management**
* Map and harmonize **multiple security frameworks**
* Execute **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**
* Design **secure cloud architecture**
* Write **auditable policies, standards, and procedures**
* Manage **third-party cybersecurity risk**
* Build **executive-level KPIs & KRIs**
* Lead **incident response and recovery**
* Support **audit and assurance activities**
* Communicate cyber risk to **boards and executives**
* Produce a **CISO-level final cybersecurity report**

---

## 🧠 Frameworks & Standards Used

* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Primary framework
* **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** – System authorization
* **NIST SP 800-53** – Security and privacy controls
* **ISO/IEC 27001** – Information Security Management System (ISMS)
* **CIS Critical Security Controls** – Prescriptive technical controls
* **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)** – Cloud-specific guidance

Frameworks are **mapped and harmonized**, reflecting real enterprise practice.

## 🧭 Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### 🔹 Phase 1 – Organization Context

Business objectives, data classification, regulatory landscape, shared responsibility model.

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Governance Framework

Board oversight, roles & responsibilities, risk appetite, escalation model, three lines of defense.

### 🔹 Phase 3 – Risk Management

Enterprise risk register, cloud risk assessment, scoring methodology, risk treatment decisions.

### 🔹 Phase 4 – Compliance & Framework Mapping

NIST CSF core mapping, ISO / CIS / CSA control harmonization, audit readiness.

### 🔹 Phase 5 – NIST RMF (Authorization)

System categorization, SSP, control assessment, POA&M, Authorization to Operate (ATO).

### 🔹 Phase 6 – Cloud Security Architecture

IAM, Zero Trust, network segmentation, encryption, logging & monitoring mapped to controls.

### 🔹 Phase 7 – Policies, Standards & Procedures

Operational security policies, enforceable standards, auditor-testable procedures.

### 🔹 Phase 8 – Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

Vendor tiering, due diligence, risk registers, contract controls, offboarding.

### 🔹 Phase 9 – Cybersecurity Metrics (KPIs & KRIs)

Executive dashboards, board-level risk indicators, decision-driven metrics.

### 🔹 Phase 10 – Incident Response & Recovery

Crisis governance, legal & regulatory coordination, tabletop exercises, post-incident reports.

### 🔹 Phase 11 – Audit & Assurance

Risk-based audit planning, control testing, evidence management, remediation tracking.

### 🔹 Phase 12 – Board & Executive Reporting

Board dashboards, risk heatmaps, investment decisions, cybersecurity roadmap.

### 🔹 Phase 13 – Final CISO Report

End-to-end cybersecurity posture, risk narrative, strategic recommendations.
