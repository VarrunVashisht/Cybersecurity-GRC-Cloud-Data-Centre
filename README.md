# Enterprise Cybersecurity GRC Capstone
Cloud Data Center | End-to-End, CISO-Grade Program

Author: Varun Vashisht
Focus: Cybersecurity Governance, Risk Management & Compliance (GRC)
Industry: Cloud Service Provider / Cloud Data Center
Level: Beginner → Executive / CISO Track

---

## Overview

This repository contains a full-scale, industry-grade Cybersecurity GRC program designed for a cloud data center environment (AWS-style architecture).

The project demonstrates how cybersecurity is governed, operated, audited, measured, automated, and defended at executive and board level — not just how controls are written.

This is not a theoretical project.
It reflects real-world decision-making, trade-offs, audit readiness, regulatory response, crisis handling, and executive communication.

## Why This Project Exists

Most cybersecurity projects stop at:
- Policies
- Framework mapping
- Tool lists

This project goes further by answering:
- How is security actually run day-to-day?
- How do risk decisions get made and defended?
- How do auditors, regulators, and boards evaluate cybersecurity?
- What happens during a breach or acquisition?
- What was consciously not secured — and why?

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- End-to-end GRC ownership
- Cloud-focused risk management
- Audit and regulatory readiness
- Executive and board reporting
- Incident and breach leadership
- Cyber risk quantification in financial terms
- Automation-aware, scalable GRC
- Mature, defensible decision-making

## Project Structure (How to Read This Repository)

Tip for recruiters and hiring managers:
Start with Phase 13 (Final CISO Report), then review Phases 25 and 26 to see executive judgment and realism.

---

### Core GRC Foundation (Phases 1–13)

01–06  Governance, Risk Frameworks, Architecture
07     Policies, Standards and Procedures
08     Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)
09     Cybersecurity Metrics (KPIs and KRIs)
10     Incident Response and Recovery
11     Audit and Assurance
12     Board and Executive Reporting
13     Final CISO Report (Capstone Summary)

These phases establish a complete, audit-ready cloud GRC program.

---

### Advanced and Executive Extensions (Phases 16–26)

16  GRC Operating Model (Day-to-Day Operations)
17  Control Ownership and Evidence Mapping
18  30-60-90 Day GRC Onboarding Plan
19  Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment
20  Cyber Risk Quantification (FAIR-style)
21  Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
22  GRC Automation and Engineering
23  Regulator and Breach Simulation
24  M&A Cyber Due Diligence
25  CISO Decision Log
26  What We Did NOT Secure (Conscious Risk Acceptance)

These phases demonstrate leadership, judgment, realism, and executive thinking.

## Highlighted Artifacts (Recommended Starting Points)

If you have limited time, review these first:

- Phase 13 – Final CISO Report
- Phase 17 – Control Ownership and Evidence Map
- Phase 20 – Cyber Risk Quantification
- Phase 25 – CISO Decision Log
- Phase 26 – What We Did NOT Secure

---

## Tools and Technology Context

This project is tool-aware but not tool-dependent.

It references realistic enterprise tooling such as:
- Cloud security and configuration monitoring
- SIEM and centralized logging
- GRC platforms and ticketing systems
- Vulnerability and third-party risk tools

The focus is on how tools support governance, risk, evidence, and decision-making — not on operating specific tools.

---

- Evidence of judgment under constraints
- Business-aligned cybersecurity leadership

---

## Author Note

This project was built to reflect how cybersecurity actually works in real organizations, including constraints, trade-offs, and imperfect conditions.

It intentionally includes:
- Accepted risks
- Deferred controls
- Cost-based decisions
- Executive judgment

Because that is reality.

Security maturity is not about perfection — it is about conscious, defensible decisions.
