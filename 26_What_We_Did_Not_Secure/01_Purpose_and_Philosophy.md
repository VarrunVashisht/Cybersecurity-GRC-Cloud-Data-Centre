# What We Did Not Secure – Purpose and Philosophy

## Purpose
This document transparently records known security gaps and areas of reduced coverage that were consciously accepted based on risk appetite, business priorities, and resource constraints.

## Philosophy
Security is about informed decisions, not absolute protection.  
Not every risk is eliminated — some are accepted deliberately.
