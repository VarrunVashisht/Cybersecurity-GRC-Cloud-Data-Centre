# Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

## ALE Formula
ALE = Loss Event Frequency × Loss Magnitude

## Example Calculation
Scenario: Cloud Misconfiguration Breach
- Estimated Frequency: 0.4 per year
- Estimated Loss Magnitude: $2M
- ALE: $800k per year

## Interpretation
This represents the expected annual financial exposure if no additional controls are implemented.
