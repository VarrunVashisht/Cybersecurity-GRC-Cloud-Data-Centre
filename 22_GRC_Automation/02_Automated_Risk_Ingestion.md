# Automated Risk Ingestion

## Risk Sources
- Cloud misconfiguration findings
- Vulnerability scan results
- Incident reports
- Third-party risk alerts

## Automation Flow
1. Tool generates finding
2. Finding mapped to risk category
3. Risk record auto-created or updated
4. Risk owner notified

## GRC Role
Review, validate, and prioritize risks — not manually collect them
